# CYBER_DECK

The Cyber_Deck is a portable, customizable computing system housed in a weatherproof case. It is built around a Raspberry Pi 5 and designed for independent security auditing and wireless experimentation. The system includes a 10-inch touchscreen, 2TB NVMe SSD for storage, and a 65,000mAh power bank. Running Kali Linux, it supports Wi-Fi and SDR-based testing and monitoring.

## Wireless and Radio Adapters

- NooElec Smart V5 SDR for radio frequency analysis
- Panda Wireless PAU0F AXE3000 WiFi 6E adapter (supports monitor mode)

Note: Various online tutorials are available for configuring these adapters with GQRX, GNU Radio, and Airmon-ng.

## Power Management Considerations

- The Raspberry Pi 5 requires ~2.7A during boot. To ensure smooth operation without manual intervention, set `max_current_enable=1` in `config.txt`.
- USB PD-compatible power banks are recommended to handle high current demand.
- If using a power bank without a hardware switch, a kill switch can be added inline between the battery and PCB. Only perform such modifications if properly trained, as lithium-ion batteries can be hazardous.

## Software and Offline Tools

- **Kiwix** for offline access to large information repositories such as Wikipedia (via ZIM files)
- **Ollama** for running lightweight local LLMs through the terminal
- **Kali Linux** full penetration testing suite

Be sure to update your system before disconnecting from the internet
