# CYBER_DECK

A portable, customizable PC in a laptop-style architecture. Housed in a weatherproof case, a Raspberry Pi 5, 65,000mAh power bank, 10" touchscreen, and 2TB SSD (USB boot) work together to run Kali Linux and operate as an independent penetration testing tool. With Wi-Fi adapters and an SDR, this machine can perform deauth attacks and scan a wide range of radio frequencies.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Power Notes

- The Pi 5 draws 27 W at boot. Modify `config.txt` with `max_current_enable=1` to avoid manual startup.
- Ensure the power bank supports USB PD (Power Delivery).
- Some power banks lack a switch. A hardware kill switch was added between the battery cell and PCB (‚ö†Ô∏è only do this if you know what you're doing‚ÄîLi-ion batteries are dangerous).
